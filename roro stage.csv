2. Stage Sequence Table
Stage	EXPLANATION
Stage 1	Arrival condition (lightship). Check initial drafts and trim.
Stage 2	TR1 roll-on start: 1st axle on ramp. Initial trim change (bow down).
Stage 3	TR1 mid-ramp: cargo COG on ramp. Progressive bow down, within limits.
Stage 4	TR1 on deck: full weight transferred to vessel deck. Verify deck & ramp condition.
Stage 5	TR1 secured at Fr.42 (aft). Drafts back to baseline; ready for D-1 pre-ballasting.
Stage 5_PreBallast	[D-1] Pre-ballast using shore water. Set intentional trim for TR2 bow moment. No major dynamic ballasting during RORO.
Stage 6A_Critical (Opt C)	[D-day] TR2 ramp entry under fixed pre-ballast condition. Check critical drafts/trim without additional pumping.
Stage 6C	Final stowage with both TRs secured. Confirm departure stability based on pre-ballast distribution.
Stage 7	Departure / reference condition after completion of RORO sequence.

0 ~ 170	> 3.65	(-) Submerged	< 2.80	DANGER (Deck Submerged)
180.00	3.64	0.01	2.88	Minimum Limit (Dry Deck)
200.00	3.60	0.05	2.98	Baseline (Draft Optimized)
